Despite her physical presence being gone, a quote from my late Aunt constantly stays with me. 

Michelle McNamara said, “It’s chaos. Be kind.” 

So many factors in society contribute to the chaos, but it’s our duty in every moment to choose kind. 

On Friday, November 24, I went to see the movie Wonder. It’s the most I’ve cried watching a movie since Marley & Me. And in both movies, Owen Wilson is the father losing a dog. No more dog movies, okay, Owen? But seriously, I balled my eyes out; it was much needed. 

Because the world is chaos, and for two hours I felt like I escaped reality watching a movie for the first time. I entered a separate world called Wonder—which is full of chaos—but left with hope about the real world. I’ve never seen a movie that has made my heart feel so deeply and motivated me to keep choosing kind.

I didn’t go see Wonder and continue on with my night after; I left the theater with tears running down my eyes, positive thoughts racing through my mind, and immeasurable joy for Augie Pulman.
