Unlike the NBA, it’s pretty hard to predict the champs every year on the ice.

The talent is incredibly balanced, with numerous teams considered legitimate contenders. There are decorated, experienced teams trying to prove they’re still built to win; there is also a wave of young teams stealing the spotlight from the familiar faces.

It’s November. One month into what was the most anticipated NHL season in years. It’s still too early to start heavily judging teams. However, here are five things worth noting:

**1)** **Chicago’s championship window could be slammed shut.** All eyes are on the Blackhawks. Their captain changed his offseason regime. Stan Bowman lost several big names, as usual. Brandon Saad was brought back to give Jonathan Toews a boost. The Hawks have made a lot of changes to say the least. How will they respond after getting embarrassed by Nashville in just four games? They won in 2010, lost two straight years in the first round, and then won in 2013. They won in 2015, lost two straight years in the first round, what will they do in 2018? It’s make or break for them this season. And the Central Division is loaded. Will Schmaltz, Hayden, Kero and DeBrincat prove to be enough up front? Will the blue line improve as the season progresses? Does Corey Crawford have enough left in the tank? For the first time in almost a decade, the Hawks will have to fight hard for a playoff spot.

**2) It’s going to be really, really hard for the Pittsburgh Penguins to three-peat.** The Penguins have Kris Letang back. Aside from losing Chris Kunitz, the roster looks the same. Sidney Crosby, Evgeni Malkin and company will try to do something that is nearly impossible in the salary cap era: win Lord Stanley three years in a row. Toronto and Tampa Bay are the biggest threats to Pittsburgh in the East. Washington is also trying to prove that their championship window is still open. Even if the Penguins come out of the East and make a third straight final, the team representing the West is going to be ready to roll.

**3) The Tampa Bay Lightning are good. Really, really good.** The Lightning were in the 2015 Stanley Cup Final. They gave the Blackhawks a run for their money. It is very likely Tampa Bay can return to the finals in 2018. Jon Cooper has his team firing at all cylinders. Two words: Nikita Kucherov. Kucherov is currently the best winger in the game, with 29 points in 17 games. Him and Steven Stamkos—who is finally looking healthy—have combined for 59 points through 17 games. To put that into perspective: Jonathan Toews and Patrick Kane have a combined 24 points through 16 games. Lightning is striking.

**4) The Pacific Division will be tight in April.** The two biggest surprises out of the Pacific this year: Vegas and Los Angeles. The Knights, the NHL’s expansion team, came shooting out of the gates, playing nothing-to-lose hockey. Vegas started the season 8-1. The LA Kings started the season 9-2 through their first 11 meetings. Are these guys only coming out hot? Will it last? They better stick with it because a healthy Anaheim Ducks team and the Edmonton Oilers are the two favorites. The Ducks may have the best blue line in the NHL and the Oilers have the best player in the NHL. Regardless, the Pacific Division race will be close.

**5) Can St. Louis finally break through?** This will be another division with a tight race. The Blues are currently first in the Western Conference with a 13-3-1 record. Led by Vladimir Tarasenko, the Blues have a lot of options up front with guys like Paul Stastny, Jaden Schwartz, Alex Steen, Vladimir Sobotka and Kyle Brodziak. On the back end, the Blues have Colton Parayko and Alex Pietrangelo. The Blues are desperate for a Stanley Cup appearance; however, a lot of teams stand in their way, most notable the Oilers, the Ducks and the Predators.
