Unlike the NBA, it’s pretty hard to predict the champs every year on the ice. 

The talent is incredibly balanced, with numerous teams considered legitimate contenders. There are decorated, experienced teams trying to prove they’re still built to win; there is also a wave of young teams stealing the spotlight from the familiar faces. 

It’s November. One month into what was the most anticipated NHL season in years. It’s still too early to start heavily judging teams. However, here are five things worth noting: 

**1)** **Chicago’s championship window could be slammed shut.** All eyes are on the Blackhawks. Their captain changed his offseason regime. Stan Bowman lost several big names, as usual. Brandon Saad was brought back to give Jonathan Toews a boost. The Hawks have made a lot of changes to say the least. How will they respond after getting embarrassed by Nashville in just four games? They won in 2010, lost two straight years in the first round, and then won in 2013. They won in 2015, lost two straight years in the first round, what will they do in 2018? It’s make or break for them this season. And the Central Division is loaded. Will Schmaltz, Hayden, Kero and DeBrincat prove to be enough up front? Will the blue line improve as the season progresses? Does Corey Crawford have enough left in the tank? For the first time in almost a decade, the Hawks will have to fight hard for a playoff spot. 

**2) It’s going to be really, really hard for the Pittsburgh Penguins to three-peat.**
