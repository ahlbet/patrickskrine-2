This creative website is dedicated to the late Michelle McNamara. Michelle always said, “It’s chaos, be kind.” To the person who showed me what it means to reduce the chaos during my time on Earth: Thank you for being a light in my life that will never fade. As the brilliant Carl Sagan said: “To live in the hearts we leave behind is to never die.”
