This website is dedicated to my late Aunt Michelle, my biggest fan and the woman who inspired my love for writing. She was a professional crime writer and a remarkable aunt, mother, sister, friend, wife and daughter.

Michelle embodied so many wonderful life lessons—she taught me to cherish family, be grateful, and laugh often, especially at myself. Her powerful voice and unwavering intelligence in her professional work were no match to how genuine she was as a person.

She is missed by everyone who knew her. Writing and creative expression are two of the many ways I honor her. She will always have a special place in my heart.

I hope my Aunt Michelle is resting somewhere, the same way her bracelet is resting on the ledge of my favorite place in the world: Toplofty in Palisades Park, Michigan.

“It's chaos. Be kind.” —Michelle McNamara

For you, Mish Mac.
