The Golden State Warriors have taken the NBA to uncharted territory. It is the super team era — the game’s biggest names are teaming up to dethrone the Warriors.

But let’s not forget: prior to the huge Kevin Durant decision, the Warriors were not a super team. Durant needs Dub Nation more than Dub Nation needs Durant. Kevin Durant winning the 2017 Finals MVP was exactly what he needed to do to earn back some respect. But the reality is the Warriors won 73 games without KD. The Warriors made two trips to the finals without KD. And if you take away KD from the 2017 finals, the Warriors are still winning; LeBron and Kyrie’s supporting cast was nowhere to be found.

NBA organizations are trying to land superstars to go all in and defeat the Warriors. But the Warriors, pre-KD era, were a normal team with draft picks who grew into stars and created exceptional chemistry. Washington State and Davidson aren’t annually producing NBA stars. Klay and Steph have earned the right to be called the Splash Brothers. Draymond Green came into the league and developed under a great system. Players like Andre Iguodola, Marreese Speights and Shaun Livingston are role players who have contributed heavily for Golden State.

But now with Kevin Durant in the picture, it’s appropriate to call them a super team. And while Golden State-Cleveland is being predicted for a fourth straight year, neither of them have totally dominated. Here are five takeaways from the NBA season three weeks in:

**1) No Hayward? No problem.** The Gordon Hayward injury on October 17 put a gloomy overcast over the entire NBA season. After dropping the first two games of the season, the Boston Celtics have won 10 straight games since. Jayson Tatum is getting a chance to gain NBA experience early; the potential is through the roof for the kid. Kyrie Irving is shining as the face of a franchise. 10-2 so far is a testament to Brad Stevens. Despite no Gordon, Boston is going to do everything they can to upset Cleveland in the East.

1. **Milwaukee, Washington and Toronto waiting to break out.** Add these teams to the mix to come out of the East in a few years. Giannis Antetokounmpo is indeed a freak. The Bucks’ front office just added Eric Bledsoe. Malcolm Brogdon is proving himself as a key contributor. Once Jabari Parker returns healthy, the Bucks can make some noise. In the nation’s capital, John Wall and Bradley Beal are confident. They are one of the more exciting duos in the league. DeMar DeRozan and Kyle Lowry want to take Toronto basketball one step further. For these three teams, the big question is whether or not they’re built to stop LeBron or Boston. The Cavs and Celitcs are locks at 1 and 2 in the East, but these teams can comfortably be 3, 4 and 5 seeds.

**3) Oklahoma City still figuring it out.** Another super team was established in the offseason, as Paul George and Carmelo Anthony arrived to town to team up with the reigning MVP Russel Westbrook. However, the Thunder have not beaten a Western conference team yet and are sitting at 4-7. Nonetheless, this team should have no problems a few months down the road. Expect the chemistry and the flow of the offense to improve drastically.

1. **James Harden is on a mission.** James Harden must be sick of hearing about the Thunder and Warriors as favorites. Averaging 29, 9 and 4 through 12 games, Harden is carrying the load with Chris Paul out due to injury. Eric Gordon, Clint Capela and Ryan Anderson are all logging huge minutes and giving James Harden substantial help at both ends of the floor. Trevor Ariza is one of the most reliable forwards in the game. Don’t count Houston out.
2. **Minnesota is capable.** The Western conference is so stacked, that the Timberwolves—a big three of Karl-Anthony Towns, Andrew Wiggins and Jimmy Butler are underdogs. Sitting at 7-4, the Wolves have to be feeling good about how they’re playing. Tom Thibodeau knows Jimmy Butler best. He came over this offseason from Chicago. If Minnesota wants to contend come April, Jimmy has to play like a superstar. Just like the team is more than capable of going deep in the playoffs, Butler is capable of dominating the same way he did in Chicago.
