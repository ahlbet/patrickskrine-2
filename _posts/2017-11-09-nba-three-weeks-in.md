The Golden State Warriors have taken the NBA to uncharted territory. It is the super team era — the game’s biggest names are teaming up to dethrone the Warriors. 

But let’s not forget: prior to the huge Kevin Durant decision, the Warriors were not a super team.** Durant needs Dub Nation more than Dub Nation needs Durant.** Kevin Durant winning the 2017 Finals MVP was exactly what he needed to do to show the basketball world that the Warriors need him. But the reality is the Warriors won 73 games without KD. The Warriors made two trips to the finals without KD. And if you take away KD from the 2017 finals, the Warriors are still winning; LeBron and Kyrie’s supporting cast was nowhere to be found. 

The point is all these organizations are trying to land superstars to go all in and defeat the Warriors. But the Warriors were not a super team before KD; they were a normal team with draft picks who grew into stars and created unwavering chemistry.
