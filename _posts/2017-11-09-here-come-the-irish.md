While the #3 ranked Notre Dame football team has a crucial game against Miami to control their fate in the college football playoffs, Mike Brey’s squad begins the season Saturday at DePaul.

Make no mistake: Notre Dame is also a basketball school.

Despite being ranked 14th in the preseason poll, Notre Dame always seems to be overlooked. It’s only a matter of time until hoops fans stop sleeping on the Irish. As Jon Rothstein says: “Betting against Mike Brey is like betting against Christian Bale in a Batman movie.”

You just don’t do it.

Although guards Steve Vasturia and VJ Beachem have graduated, Notre Dame reloads rather than rebuilds. Sophomore TJ Gibbs and Junior Rex Pflueger are ready to take on much bigger roles. Pflueger, who was a standout player at Mater Dei in Southern California, is known for his defensive efforts; however, Brey will rely on him much more this year offensively. TJ Gibbs gained a lot of confidence as a Freshman, and worked all offseason on getting faster and stronger.

John Mooney, Austin Torres, DJ Harvey, Elijah Burns and Nikola Djogo will be the depth off the bench this year. Mike Brey has confidence in all these guys, and they will all contribute in some way considering they play for the “loosest coach in America.” In South Bend, the basketball is beautiful — there’s a lot of freedom offensively, which allows players to showcase their talents and find their groove.

Matt Farrell was not the most improved point guard in college basketball last year; he was the most improved player. Period. Farrell is incredibly smooth off ball screens — he can find the open man on the perimeter, finish at the rim with great finesse, or dish it off to Bonzie Colson for an easy two. Matt Farrell is fast. Matt Farrell is smart. Matt Farrell is skilled. The offense goes as he goes.

Last but certainly not least, the two big guys in the middle: Martinas Geben and Bonzie Colson. Irish fans may be most impressed by the improvement of Geben. He won a gold medal with Lithuania this offseason and has really grown comfortable around the rim. He’s another guy who needed a big confidence boost. It’s a common trend in the Notre Dame program. When you play for Mike Brey, your confidence is sky high. Notre Dame basketball players are calm, cool and collected. They have fun, just like the coaching staff.

Bonzie Colson. The buzz around this guy is booming. The whole nation is talking about him as one of the best overall players in college basketball. He is 6’6 and experts are calling him the best big man in the nation. He is the most exciting player to watch — he can cause problems for teams on the block, in the midrange game and from three point territory. Coming off a stellar Junior season and being named a preseason 1st team All-American heading into his Senior year, Bonzie is ready to give Irish fans another Final Four appearance.

Bonzie Colson is considered one of the top five players in the nation. He is in the same sentence as Miles Bridges (Michigan State), Allonzo Trier (Arizona), Jalen Brunson (Villanova) and Michael Porter Jr. (Missouri). Needless to say that is elite company.

\*Insert Dick Vitale voice\* “How ‘bout that kid Bonzie Colson! Are you serious?!”

The Notre Dame Fighting Irish prove themselves every year in the ACC. The ACC was the deepest conference in college basketball last year. The Irish, when flying around on defense and knocking down triples, can beat anybody in America. 

Don’t sleep on ND.
