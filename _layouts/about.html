    <div class="about-text">

      <p><strong>My name is Patrick Skrine. I’m from Oak Park, Illinois and a graduate of Oak Park River Forest High School, where I played basketball and football.</strong></p>

      <p>I am a communication major, hopeful to pursue a career in public relations, sports marketing, or even teaching/coaching. I’m currently a sophomore at Triton College but will transfer to a four-year university next fall. Considering I have many different interests, the beauty of communication is that it allows one to apply their skills in many different areas.</p>

      <p>Although a place to showcase my thoughts and experiences, my website is also my platform to discuss the sports world, especially my three favorite leagues: the NHL, the NBA and College Basketball.</p>

      <p>First semester of freshman year, prior to transferring to Triton, I attended Holy Cross College at Notre Dame. I gained my first writing experience at the University of Notre Dame, contributing for their paper as a sports reporter.</p>

      <p>I now serve as a sports intern for the Wednesday Journal, a local publisher based in my hometown of Oak Park. Marty Farmer, the sports editor, has been an exceptional mentor, allowing me to get my foot in the door with real-world experience in sports journalism.</p>

      <p>Basketball has been my ultimate passion when it comes to sports. I currently coach two teams and train clients one-on-one. Working with kids on and off the court has solidified my interest in school-teaching.</p>

      <p>I’ve had many special experiences and have met so many wonderful people. My goal is to continue on this journey and connect with others who have similar passions.</p>
