        My name is Patrick Skrine and I created this platform to reflect,
        create, and connect. I consider this a place to reach a deeper sense of
        meaning and cultivate a stronger connection to humanity.

        As The Eagles said in their hit song Take It Easy: “We may lose and we
        may win, though we will never be here again.”

        I hope the content here can help others reach a deeper understanding and
        appreciation of life. And to be where our feet are in every moment.

        All we have is this one life, as we are going to the end of the line.
        There is no right time. There is just time and what we choose to do with
        it.
